Hi! Welcome to my C++ code editor. It's still a work in progress, but I'm excited to keep building and adding more features!

Over 53000 lines of code!

## Current Features
- **Saving**
- **Loading**
- **Terminal**
- **Python Integration**
- **PIP**
- **Html code running**
- **Custom Theme's!**
- **Dev settings, and custom ui elements**

This is just the beginning, expect many more features!

## Documentation
For a very basic editor documentation, you can visit: [Editor Documentation](https://k754a.github.io/Editor%20Documentation). I'll be adding more soon!

## Installation Guide


New install guide! You can use the one below for more users who plan to code/Add to the editor!

(**NEW**) This is then new exe [installer.](https://github.com/k754a/C-Custom-Code-Editor/blob/main/Installer/C%20write-INSTALLER.exe)

(**OLD**) A guide for the old installation is out [here.](https://k754a.github.io/Editor%20Documentation)
