My C++ CUSTOM CODE EDITOR

Hi! this is my C++ code editor, and it’s still a work in progress. Currently, it doesn’t have many features, but I’ll be adding wayyyy more stuff soon!

What we do have:

-saving
-loading
-terminal
-python intigration, to run custom code
-pip


very basic editor documentation, adding more soon :)
