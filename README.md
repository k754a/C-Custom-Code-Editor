# My C++ Custom Code Editor

Hi! Welcome to my C++ code editor. It's still a work in progress, but I'm excited to keep building and adding more features soon!

## Current Features
- **Saving**
- **Loading**
- **Terminal**
- **Python Integration** - Run custom code directly
- **PIP** - Manage your Python packages

This is just the beginning; expect many more features in the near future!

## Documentation
For a very basic editor documentation, you can visit: [Editor Documentation](https://k754a.github.io/Editor%20Documentation). I'll be adding more soon!

## Installation Guide
A guide for installation will be available soon.

Thanks for checking it out!
